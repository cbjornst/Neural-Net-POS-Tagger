Congress/IN learned/DT during/IN the/DT Reagan/NN administration/NN that/IN it/PRP could/NN intimidate/NNP the/DT executive/NN branch/NN by/IN uttering/NN again/IN and/CC again/IN the/DT same/NN seven/NN words/NN :/NN ``/`` Provided/NN ,/, that/IN no/NNP funds/VBD shall/JJ be/VB spent/NN .../NN ./. ''/'' 
This/NNP phrase/IN once/NN again/IN is/VBZ found/CD throughout/IN the/DT many/NN appropriations/NN bills/JJ now/NN moving/NN through/NN Congress/NN ./. 
It/NNP signals/NNP Congress/NNP 's/POS attempt/NNP ,/, under/VBD the/DT pretext/NN of/IN guarding/VBD the/DT public/NN purse/NN ,/, to/TO deny/VB the/DT president/NN the/DT funding/NN necessary/JJ to/TO execute/JJ certain/VB of/IN his/IN duties/CC and/CC prerogatives/NN specified/NN in/IN Article/NN II/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN ./. 
This/NNP species/NN of/IN congressional/DT action/NN is/VBZ predicated/NNP on/IN an/DT interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN that/IN is/VBZ erroneous/NN and/CC unconstitutional/NN ./. 
The/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN states/NNP that/IN ``/`` No/JJ Money/NN shall/JJ be/VB drawn/IN from/IN the/DT Treasury/NN ,/, but/NN in/IN Consequence/NN of/IN Appropriations/NNP made/DT by/IN Law/NNS .../NN ./. ''/''

This/NNP interpretation/NN was/VBD officially/NN endorsed/NN by/IN Congress/IN in/IN 1987/NN in/IN the/DT Iran-Contra/NN Report/NN ./. 
As/NNP partisans/NNP of/IN congressional/DT power/NNP understand/NNP ,/, a/DT ``/`` power/NN of/IN the/DT purse/NN ''/'' so/JJ broadly/NN construed/NNP would/IN emasculate/JJ the/DT presidency/NN and/CC swallow/IN the/DT principle/NN of/IN separation/NN of/IN powers/NN ./. 
It/PRP is/VBZ not/NNP supported/NNP by/IN the/DT text/NN or/VBD history/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN ./. 
The/DT framers/NNP hardly/NNP discussed/IN the/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN at/IN the/DT Constitutional/NN Convention/NN of/IN 1787/NN ,/, according/IN to/TO Madison/NNP 's/POS notes/NN ./. 
To/NNP the/DT extent/NN they/NN did/NN ,/, their/JJ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/CD fiscal/VBD accountability/NN ./. 
Moreover/NNP ,/, the/DT framers/NN believed/IN that/IN the/DT nation/NN needed/NN a/DT unitary/NN executive/NN with/IN the/DT independence/NN and/CC resources/NN to/TO perform/VB the/DT executive/NN functions/NN that/IN the/DT Confederation/NN Congress/IN had/IN performed/NN poorly/NN under/NN the/DT Articles/NN of/IN Confederation/NN ./. 
It/NNP would/IN contradict/NNP that/IN objective/NN if/IN the/DT appropriations/NN clause/NN (/VBD technically/NN a/DT limitation/NN on/IN legislative/IN power/JJ )/NN could/NN be/VB read/NN as/IN placing/NNP the/DT president/NN on/IN Congress/NN 's/POS short/NN leash/NN ,/, making/DT the/DT executive/NN consist/NN of/IN the/DT president/NN and/CC every/NNP member/NN of/IN Congress/IN ./. 
As/NNP it/PRP went/DT to/TO the/DT conference/NN panel/NNP now/NN deliberating/NN ,/, the/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/IN of/IN the/DT president/NN for/IN fiscal/VBD 1990/IN contained/IN some/CC breathtaking/NN attempts/NN by/IN Congress/IN to/TO rewrite/VB the/DT Constitution/NN under/NN the/DT pretext/NN of/IN protecting/NN the/DT public/NN 's/POS money/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT coming/NN weeks/NN ,/, President/JJ Bush/NN must/NN decide/NN whether/JJ to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NN containing/CC them/NN --/JJ or/NN ,/, alternatively/NN ,/, to/TO sign/JJ these/NNP bills/JJ into/NN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/NN their/JJ intrusions/NN on/IN executive/NN power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/NN II/NN ,/, and/CC thus/CC void/NN and/CC severable/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/PRP appropriations/NN legislation/NN attempts/NN to/TO strip/IN the/DT president/NN of/IN his/IN powers/NN to/TO make/VB certain/VB appointments/NN as/IN provided/NNP by/IN Article/NN II/NN ./. 
Article/NNP II/NNP places/NNP on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/NN to/TO nominate/NNP ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/NN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NN and/CC Consent/NN of/IN the/DT Senate/NN ''/'' appoint/NNP ,/, ambassadors/NNP ,/, judges/NNP ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NN ./. 
It/PRP also/DT empowers/VBD the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NNP appointments/NN ,/, without/IN Senate/NN approval/JJ :/NN ``/`` The/DT President/NN shall/JJ have/NN Power/NN to/TO fill/NN up/IN all/JJ Vacancies/NN that/IN may/, happen/VBD during/IN the/DT Recess/NN of/IN the/DT Senate/NN ,/, by/IN granting/NN Commissions/VBZ which/NN shall/JJ expire/NN at/IN the/DT End/NN of/IN their/JJ next/NN Session/NN ./. ''/'' 
Yet/NNP Section/IN 605/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/IN provides/JJ :/NN ``/`` No/NNP part/NN of/IN any/NN appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/NN fiscal/NN year/NNP contained/NN in/IN this/DT or/NN any/NN other/JJ Act/NN shall/JJ be/VB paid/VBD to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/NN position/NN for/IN which/NN he/IN or/VBD she/IN has/VBZ been/JJ nominated/NN after/IN the/DT Senate/NN has/NN voted/VBZ not/NN to/TO approve/CC the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBD person/NN ./. ''/'' 
Thus/NNP ,/, with/IN one/NNP brief/VBD passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN ,/, Congress/IN repeals/NN the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NNP appointments/NN under/NNS Article/NN II/NN ./. 
Section/IN 605/NNP also/IN imposes/NN unconstitutional/VBD conditions/NN on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NNP to/TO nominate/VB candidates/NN of/IN his/IN choosing/NN ./. 
The/DT language/NNP of/IN the/DT appropriations/NN rider/NN implies/NN that/IN any/NN nomination/NN to/TO any/CD position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/NN nominee/NN will/VBD result/NN in/IN the/DT president/NN being/NN denied/VBD funding/NN to/TO pay/VBZ that/IN person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./. 
The/DT president/NNP could/NNP probably/NNP not/NN avoid/VBD this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/NN people/NN willing/NNP to/TO serve/IN without/IN pay/NNP ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NN Act/NN prohibits/NN voluntary/POS service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./. 
The/DT 1990/NNP appropriations/NN bills/NN also/IN contain/NN a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/NN ''/'' provisions/VBZ that/IN violate/NN the/DT recommendation/NN clause/NN in/IN Article/NN II/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN ./. 
Muzzling/NNP provisions/NNP ,/, which/NNP might/NN be/VB called/NN ``/`` blindfold/NN laws/NN ''/'' as/IN well/NN ,/, prevent/DT the/DT executive/NN branch/NN from/IN even/NN looking/NN at/IN certain/NN policy/NN options/NN ,/, let/IN alone/VBZ from/IN recommending/DT them/NN to/TO Congress/VB ./. 
Such/NNP laws/NN violate/DT the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NN II/NN that/IN requires/NN the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/NNP to/TO Congress/NNP ,/, but/JJ which/VBZ gives/NN the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/IN the/DT subject/NN matter/NN of/IN those/VBD recommendations/NN ./. 
Typically/NNP ,/, these/NNP laws/NNP seek/NNP to/TO prevent/VB executive/DT branch/IN officials/NN from/IN inquiring/NN into/IN whether/JJ certain/NN federal/JJ programs/NN make/IN any/JJ economic/NN sense/NN or/VBD proposing/JJ more/NN market-oriented/NNS alternatives/VBZ to/TO regulations/NN ./. 
Probably/IN the/DT most/NN egregious/NN example/NNP is/VBZ a/DT proviso/DT in/IN the/DT appropriations/NN bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/IN that/IN prevents/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NN of/IN Management/IN and/CC Budget/NNP from/IN subjecting/NN agricultural/IN marketing/IN orders/IN to/TO any/CD cost-benefit/NN scrutiny/NN ./. 
There/NNP is/VBZ something/NN inherently/NN suspect/IN about/NN Congress/NN 's/POS prohibiting/IN the/DT executive/NN from/IN even/NN studying/NN whether/JJ public/NN funds/VBD are/VBD being/NNP wasted/NN in/IN some/CD favored/JJ program/JJ or/NN other/NN ./. 
Perhaps/NNP none/NNP of/IN the/DT unconstitutional/NN conditions/NN contained/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NN bills/NN for/IN fiscal/VBD 1990/IN better/DT illustrates/NN Congress/NNP 's/POS attempt/NNP to/TO usurp/CD executive/NN power/NN than/NN Section/IN 609/NN of/IN the/DT executive-office/NN bill/NN :/NN ``/`` None/NN of/IN the/DT funds/NN made/DT available/NN pursuant/NN to/TO the/DT provisions/NN of/IN this/DT Act/NN shall/JJ be/VB used/NN to/TO implement/NN ,/, administer/NN ,/, or/NNP enforce/NN any/NN regulation/NN which/VBZ has/VBZ been/JJ disapproved/IN pursuant/NN to/TO a/DT resolution/NN of/IN disapproval/NN duly/NN adopted/NN in/IN accordance/NNP with/IN the/DT applicable/NN law/NN of/IN the/DT United/NN States/NN ./. ''/'' 
This/NNP provision/NNP amounts/NN to/TO a/DT legislative/NN veto/CD over/NN the/DT president/NN 's/POS execution/NN of/IN the/DT law/NN ,/, since/NN a/DT one-house/NN resolution/JJ could/NN be/VB said/VBD to/TO be/VB ``/`` duly/NN adopted/NN ''/'' even/JJ though/NN it/PRP would/IN require/NN neither/NN bicameral/NNP action/NNP in/IN Congress/IN nor/NN presentation/NN to/TO the/DT president/NN for/IN his/NNP signature/NN or/NN veto/NNS ./. 
The/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP 's/POS decision/NN in/IN INS/NNP v./NN Chadha/NNP held/NNP that/IN legislative/IN vetoes/NN are/NN unconstitutional/NN ./. 
President/NNP Bush/NNP should/NNP veto/NN appropriations/NN acts/NN that/IN contain/NN these/NN kinds/NNP of/IN unconstitutional/VBD conditions/NN on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NNP to/TO discharge/PRP his/IN duties/CC and/CC exercise/VBZ his/IN prerogatives/NN ./. 
If/NNP President/JJ Bush/NNP fails/NNP to/TO do/VB so/NNP in/IN his/IN first/NN year/NN ,/, he/PRP will/VBD invite/NN Congress/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT remainder/NN of/IN his/IN presidency/NNP ,/, to/TO rewrite/CC Article/NN II/NN of/IN the/DT Constitution/NN to/TO suit/VBZ its/VB purposes/NN ./. 
What/DT becomes/NN custom/DT in/IN the/DT Bush/NN administration/NN will/VBD only/NNP become/VBZ more/NN difficult/VBD for/IN future/NN presidents/NN ,/, including/NN Democrats/NN ,/, to/TO undo/DT ./. 
President/DT Reagan/NN learned/NN that/IN lesson/NN ./. 
By/NNP 1987/NN ,/, then-Speaker/NNP Jim/NNP Wright/NN was/VBD discussing/NN arms/NN control/NN in/IN Moscow/NNP with/IN Mikhail/NN Gorbachev/NN and/CC then/NN attempting/CD to/TO direct/CD the/DT president/NN ,/, through/NNP an/DT appropriations/NN rider/NN ,/, to/TO treat/VB the/DT Soviets/NN as/IN though/NN the/DT Senate/NN had/NN ratified/NN SALT/NN II/NN ./. 
If/NNP a/DT veto/NN is/VBZ unworkable/NNP because/NNP it/PRP would/IN leave/NN part/NN of/IN the/DT executive/NN branch/NN unfunded/NN ,/, the/DT president/NN could/NN sign/NN the/DT appropriations/NN bills/NN into/NN law/NN and/CC assert/NN a/DT power/NN of/IN excision/NN ,/, declaring/JJ the/DT rider/NN restricting/NN his/IN Article/NN II/NN powers/NN to/TO be/VB unconstitutional/VBD and/CC severable/NN ./.

Too/NNP often/NNP now/NNP ,/, a/DT single/IN court/NN decision/NN becomes/NN the/DT precedent/NN for/IN other/NN ,/, less/NN compelling/NN cases/NN ./.

But/NNP as/IN Duke/IN University/NN law/NN professor/NN William/NN Van/NNP Alstyne/NN notes/NN ,/, by/IN this/DT reasoning/NNP a/DT defendant/VBD could/NN be/VB held/NNP liable/NN in/IN New/NNP York/NNP for/IN a/DT bad/NN apple/NN even/NN if/IN he/IN sold/NN all/JJ his/IN apples/NN in/IN California/NN ./.
